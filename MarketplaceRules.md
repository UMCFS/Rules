`Updated 01/21/2025`

*First, some things to define:*

**Base Value** -
__Purchased from an authorized retailer:__ the amount of money paid for your item on a receipt after any discounts, but before taxes and other costs.
__Purchased from a private party or non-authorized retailer:__ the lowest value between these sources shall be used: the actual item sale price (before tax etc.), MSRP, or the current item pricing from an authorized retailer.

**(At) Cost** - Cost is the **Base Value**, plus applicable real, direct costs, such as tax paid, shipping charges paid, and the cost of a Micro Center transferrable warranty, if applicable.

**Full system build** - A functioning PC, minus peripherals and OS. A full build shall be assembled with a case, PSU, motherboard, CPU, RAM, disk, and modern GPU. **To qualify as a full system build, the PC must contain a discrete GPU currently being manufactured and sold** such as Nvidia RTX 4000/3000 series, or AMD RX 7000/6000 series. This discourages those shucking GPUs out of pre-builts and reselling here.

**Marketplace regions** - Regions are based on Micro Center store location clusters, plus a National channel for shipped items. Below is how the stores have been grouped, post to your closest region:
* West - Tustin and Santa Clara, CA
* Mountain - Denver, CO
* Midwest - St.Louis Pk, MN; Overlnd Pk, KS; Brentwood, MO; Chicago and Westmont, IL; Madison Hgts, MI; Indy, IN
* Ohio - Sharonville, Columbus, and Mayfield Heights, OH
* Texas - Houston and Dallas
* Southeast - Duluth and Marietta, GA; Miami, FL
* Mid-Atlantic - Fairfax, VA; Rockville and Parkville, MD;  St. Davids, PA
* Northeast - North Jersey, NJ; Westbury, Yonkers, Flushing, and Brooklyn, NY; Cambridge, MA

If you're willing to sell and ship domestically to a buyer using PayPal G&S, then you may cross-post to National.

*Now onto the rules:*

1. **NO SCALPING OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXTREME MARKET DEMAND.**
```diff
-You may list your item for no more than its **cost** +$50 of profit.
```
```diff
-If your build qualifies as a full build, as defined above, you may list it for no more than its **cost** +$200 of profit/build fees. Exception - if you are a legitimate business entity registered in your state, you may continue pricing your full build fees for your business channels as you do today, but any full builds listed here are capped at +$200.
```
This profit can be used to recoup gas, fulfill a finders fee, cover your time and labor, etc., and included in your cost breakdown (see below).

**You must include a breakdown of actual costs paid; this shows buyers how you calculated your listing price.** All potential buyers should request receipts from sellers. See [Listing Rules] for information on how to show these in your listing.

**This rule applies to trade deals as well *on both ends*.** Where cash is supplied by whichever party has the lower overall cost.

And while we vehemently discourage buying from scalpers or encouraging others to do so, we don't intend to ban buyers who have purchased from scalpers.
```diff
- As a reminder, application of this rule extends beyond this marketplace; it includes your selling and trading activity outside of this server, such as on Reddit HWS and FB Marketplace. Scalping off server will result in a ban.
```
2. **Marketplace channels are limited to listings only.** Discussions and commentary about listings are not allowed within marketplace channels; your DMs should be open if you're expecting to negotiate for your marketplace listing.

3. **Any offer to sell or trade hardware must be listed in the marketplace.** This prevents those below Active Member status ("Green" / Level 10) from offering items for sale ad-hoc in other channels of the server. You may link to your marketplace-listed offering in chat channels, but you may not outright offer to sell or trade items on this server outside of the marketplace.

**Users must be Active Member status ("Green" / Level 10) or above to POST in the marketplace.** This is to protect buyers from scammers. You can check your level by typing \rank in <#954038539400650782>.

**Please follow H-W-L-N format.** H - have, W - want, L - location, N - notes , in that order. Example:
```
[H] New EVGA 3080 FTW3 Ultra (paid $1035 with tax)
[W] $1085 ($1035 + $50)
[L] Columbus, Ohio
[N] Notes
```
Notes may be used to indicate any additional information about your listing.

4. **Marketplace is intended for hardware only.** We intend for computer components, peripherals, and other DIY-related content to be posted in the marketplace. There is some leeway with this, since hardware is loosely defined, but obscure or unrelated content will be removed, such as couches.

5. **All listings require a current timestamp.** You must take a picture of the item with your username and date somewhere in the image. It cannot be digitally added to a picture (i.e. photoshopped); must be either handwritten or displayed on a digital device in the photo, like a tablet or phone.

6. **All items in listings must be physically in hand.** No posting pictures of a Newegg win prior to buying or receiving it. Have the item in hand, then post.

7. **All selling listings require an asking price.**

8. **Want-to-buy requests are now allowed in the proper marketplace channel** WTB listings follow the same H-W-L-N format as sales listings, where [H] is a dollar amount the prospective buyer is willing to pay (simply writing "cash/paypal" or the like not acceptable) for what you want in [W]. These listings must be posted into <#966469449676914719>; no other marketplace channels are appropriate for WTB posts.

9. **When using PayPal G&S, you cannot ask a buyer to explicitly pay for transactions fees.** For sake of our marketplace, you may include those fees in your "Shipping & Handling" costs. Otherwise asking a buyer to pay transactions fees directly is against PayPal's terms of use.

10.  **Do not delete completed listings** If you have sold or traded your item, please edit the listing with ~~strikeout~~, and add **SOLD** or **TRADED**, but please do not delete. If you wish to withdraw your unfulfilled listing entirely, then it is OK to delete.

[Notes]
```
**We take the marketplace seriously.** It is one of the most controversial concepts for a Discord server, especially when we enforce a no-scalping policy. As such, understand that every action comes with discussion amongst the staff members.

**Be smart about what you do online.** We do everything we can to prevent scamming or exploitation, but we are not perfect. Please use caution, and report suspicious behavior to <@575252669443211264>.

**Marketplace is a privilege.** As stated before, the marketplace is controversial. We want to make user experience fantastic - if we feel that the marketplace has become toxic or manipulated, we will remove it.


**By reacting :white_check_mark:, you agree to these rules. You also agree to the rules of other marketplaces, when applicable.**
