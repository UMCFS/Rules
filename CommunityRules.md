**You must read and agree to the rules by reacting to the :white_check_mark: at the bottom to gain access to the server**, at this point if you don't have access please read the rules again in their entirety before sending a DM to <@575252669443211264>.

1. **NO SCALPING.** This rule extends beyond our marketplace. 
We do not condone scalping, as it encourages toxic conversation and behavior. As such, users are not allowed to scalp on this server nor other marketplaces. We have this strict rule for a reason - what point is there to allow people to scalp in other marketplaces and utilize the resources of our community when it is against our rules? For more information on this rule, please see <#892606881581899826>.

**Users will be banned if found scalping.**
 
2. **Do not post listings that are outside of the marketplace.** This is considered spam, and goes against the marketplace rules. 

3. **Violating, or encouraging the violation of Micro Center policies, committing return fraud, or attempting to circumvent customer fairness policies (__such as the graphics card restrictions__)  is strictly prohibited.** __It doesn't matter if there is some special case or there are employees that guide you around these policies, this will get you banned. __

4. **Be kind and respectful. Don't be rude or disrespectful no easier way to say it.**
 
5. **No political discussion. All this will do is cause arguments.** Staff will stop these conversations fast and efficiently how they see fit.
 
6. **No spam. Violations will result in warnings and/or mutes.** Bots will be removed.
 
7. **Spreading false information __maliciously __ is prohibited. **We will not accept users trying to misguide others. Staff will determine collaboratively if malicious intention is present.
 
8. **Referral links to products are not allowed.** Referral codes (EVGA Associates) is an exception: please keep them in your bio or status, not your nickname or display name; a reference in your nickname may be added to refer to your bio or status, e.g. "Nickname (EVGA code in bio)".

9. **Advertising other servers whether in the server or in dms, without the permission of a admin is forbidden.** Please DM <@575252669443211264> if you would like to request permission to share a particular server.

14.** We oppose the discussion of bots in the server.** This is case-by-case, but in many instances bots are used with the intention to purchase multiple and resell. This goes against the mission of the server, and in many cases the terms of service for respective companies.

- NOTES
```

 **We are not responsible for activity in DMs. ** There can be times when people DM you regarding information in stores, or regarding marketplace interactions or other content. Use your best judgement when clicking on links or negotiating deals. We actively watch out for potential scam events, but cannot prevent or reverse a scam.
 
**Report any suspicious activity to <@575252669443211264>. DMing a staff member will be a slow response. **

**For EVGA, Newegg successes, you are permitted to "give" them to other users.** Spread the wealth. We are not responsible for any data leaks or compromised information should you choose to allow others to log into your accounts. 
 
**Discord links are disabled.** This is because of some NSFW servers and bot protection.
 
**Slowmode channels are slowmode for a reason. **Look before you type. For example, our server has stock channels designed specifically to notify people of stock at a particular store. You are not to clutter these channels with questions or discussions, as staff will consider it spam and it will be removed. 
 
**Marketplace is a privilege.** Marketplace is a feature designed to accommodate the community. It is not the main feature of this server. At any point that we deem it more bad than good, we will remove it. Lets make it fair and good for everyone.
