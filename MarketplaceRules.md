`Updated 03/07/2025`

Welcome to our marketplace!

**Users must be Active Member status ("Green" / Level 10) or above to LIST or SELL in the marketplace.** This is to protect buyers from scammers. You can check your level by typing \rank in <#954038539400650782>. Anyone who agrees to marketplace rules may transact.

**Marketplace regions** - Regions are based on store location clusters, plus a National channel for shipped items. Below are the regions:
* West - Tustin and Santa Clara, CA
* Mountain - Denver, CO
* Midwest - St.Louis Park, MN; Overland Park, KS; Brentwood, MO; Chicago and Westmont, IL; Madison Heights, MI; Indianapolis, IN
* Ohio - Sharonville, Columbus, and Mayfield Heights, OH
* Texas - Dallas and Houston, TX
* Southeast - Duluth and Marietta, GA; Charlotte, NC; Miami, FL
* Mid-Atlantic - Fairfax, VA; Rockville and Parkville, MD;  St. Davids, PA
* Northeast - North Jersey, NJ; Westbury, Yonkers, Flushing, and Brooklyn, NY; Cambridge, MA

If you're willing to sell and ship to a buyer using PayPal G&S, then you may cross-post to National, otherwise please pick one region for your listing.

1. **REMINDER: NO SCALPING OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXTREME MARKET DEMAND.**
This is fully defined in <#892488347036041267>. You must include a breakdown of actual costs paid; this shows buyers how you calculated your listing price. All potential buyers should request receipts from sellers. See [Listing Rules] for information on how to show these in your listing.

> **Exception for alike model trades:** Trades for alike models (e.g. a 5090 for a 5090) can be traded freely and not subject to the cost +$50 cap. This does not apply for trades for unalike models (e.g. a 5080 for a 5090) - those need to be equalized within $50 of cost.

2. **Marketplace channels are limited to listings only.** Discussions and commentary about listings are not allowed within marketplace channels; your DMs should be open if you're expecting to negotiate for your marketplace listing.

3. **Any offer to sell or trade hardware must be listed in the marketplace.** This prevents those below Active Member status ("Green" / Level 10) from offering items for sale ad-hoc in other channels of the server. You may link to your marketplace-listed offering in chat channels, but you may not outright offer to sell or trade items on this server outside of the marketplace.

**Please follow H-W-L-N format.** H - have, W - want, L - location, N - notes , in that order. Example:
```
[H] New EVGA 3080 FTW3 Ultra (paid $1035 with tax)
[W] $1085 ($1035 + $50)
[L] Columbus, Ohio
[N] Notes
```
Notes may be used to indicate any additional information about your listing.

4. **Marketplace is intended for hardware only.** Such as computer components, peripherals, and other DIY-related content to be posted in the marketplace. There is some leeway with this, since hardware is loosely defined, but obscure or unrelated content will be removed, such as couches or cars.

5. **All listings require a current timestamp.** You must take a picture of the item with your username and date somewhere in the image. It cannot be digitally added to a picture (i.e. photoshopped); must be either handwritten or displayed on a digital device in the photo, like a tablet or phone.

6. **All items in listings must be physically in hand.** No posting pictures of a Newegg win prior to buying or receiving it. Have the item in hand, then post.

7. **All selling listings require an asking price.**

8. **Want-to-buy requests are now allowed in the proper marketplace channel** WTB listings follow the same H-W-L-N format as sales listings, where [H] is a dollar amount the prospective buyer is willing to pay (simply writing "cash/paypal" or the like not acceptable) for what you want in [W]. These listings belong in <#966469449676914719> only.

9. **You cannot ask a buyer to explicitly pay for transaction fees.** Such as with PayPal G&S. For sake of our marketplace, you may include those fees in your "Shipping & Handling" costs. 

10.  **Do not delete completed listings** If you have sold or traded your item, please edit the listing with ~~strikeout~~, and add **SOLD** or **TRADED**, but please do not delete. If you wish to withdraw your unfulfilled listing entirely, then it is OK to delete.

[Notes]

**We take the marketplace seriously.** It is one of the most controversial concepts for a Discord server, especially when we enforce a no-scalping policy. As such, understand that every action comes with discussion amongst the staff members.

**Be smart about what you do online.** We do everything we can to prevent scamming or exploitation, but we are not perfect. Please use caution, and report suspicious behavior to <@575252669443211264>.

**Marketplace is a privilege.** As stated before, the marketplace is controversial. We want to make user experience fantastic - if we feel that the marketplace has become toxic or manipulated, we will remove it.

**By reacting :white_check_mark:, you agree to these rules. You also agree to the rules of other marketplaces, when applicable.**
