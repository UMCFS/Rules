**You must read and agree to the rules to gain access to the server.**
**We follow ALL Discord Community Guidelines and abide by ALL clauses in Discord's Terms of Service. The staff team has FULL discretion regarding CG and ToS violations:**

   `Discord Community Guidelines:` https://discord.com/guidelines
   `Discord Terms of Service:` https://discord.com/terms

** Staff may moderate at their discretion.** While we've tried our best to write a comprehensive set of rules, nothing is perfect and not all situations may be considered. Any attempts to circumvent rules will not be tolerated, and staff has discretion to moderate anything beyond what's listed if we deem inappropriate.

- Note - Our moderation bots (Warship and Dyno) use DMs to let users know when they've committed infractions. Blocking the bots or failure to enable DMs on this server may result in eventual warn, mute, kick, or ban without notification.

[Rules]
```
1. **NO SCALPING OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXTREME MARKET DEMAND.** 
Scalping has many similar definitions, but we define scalping in two ways:
* Taking advantage of market shortages by selling items far above cost
* Deliberate purchasing of in-demand items with the express intent to resell for profit

This includes but is not limited to all tech-related items, e.g. those sold at Micro Center, and applies to any/all marketplaces: eBay, Reddit /r/hardwareswap, Facebook Marketplace, in line at MC, etc. This does not apply to custom keyboards.

**You agree not to scalp on this Discord or anywhere else**. These behaviors encourages toxic conversation and behavior, add no economic value, and cause hardship and frustration for users who want to buy hardware at a reasonable price. **Users will be banned if found scalping.** 

We do not care about resell of items like shoes and concert tickets, but we do reserve the right to exercise discretion as warranted, e.g. those who were caught scalping baby formula during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For more information on this rule, including how scalping is defined in detail for purposes of resell here in our marketplace, please see <#892606881581899826>.

2. **Violating, or encouraging the violation of Micro Center policies, or committing return fraud, is strictly prohibited.**

3. **Be kind and respectful.** This rule is broadly written for a reason, so please apply common sense here. This includes attempts to circumvent the censored word list.

4. **No political discussion.**

5. **No spam. Violations will result in warnings and/or mutes.**

6. **Spreading false information __maliciously__ is prohibited.** We will not accept users trying to misguide others. Staff will determine if malicious intention is present.

7. **Links with embedded referral codes, QR codes, or links to crowdfunding (GoFundMe, etc.) are not allowed.**

8. **Advertising other Discords, whether in the server or in DMs, without the permission of an admin is forbidden.** Please DM <@575252669443211264> if you would like to request permission to share a particular server.

9. **Don't ask questions about stock in stock-alerts channels.** Messages in stock-alerts channels are intended to *provide* information about what's in stock at the store. Questions about stock can be directed to specific store-chat channels.

[TOS INTERPRETATIONS FOR OUR SERVER]
```
10. **Ban evasion is forbidden.** Creating a new account to get around a ban will result in your new account being banned, along with report to Discord Trust and Safety, who will likely terminate all of your accounts permanently.

11. **Discussion of non-official retailers of keys and licensure for games, operating systems, etc. is forbidden.** Secondhand marketplaces such as G2A and Kinguin contain keys of unknown origin - this means your purchase may have been legal, but the origin of the purchase may not have been.

12. **Posting NSFW content in non-age restricted channels is forbidden.** Gore (and sadistic content), sexual content, nudity, glorification of suicide, murder, violence, extremism are not allowed. This includes in meme format.

13. **Hate speech is forbidden.** We do not condone hate speech of any race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, socio-economic status, religious affiliation or disability. This includes meme content. Users violating this rule will be banned.

14. **Threats will be taken seriously.** There have been a number of instances in our server history where people have made threats involving guns, knifes, etc.
 
15. **We oppose the discussion of bots in the server.** This is case-by-case, but in many instances bots are used with the intention to purchase multiple and resell. This goes against the mission of the server, and in many cases the terms of service for respective companies. 

16. **Doxxing is forbidden.** Doxxing is the revealing of *private*, identifying information about someone in a public, online setting. This includes threats towards or revealing information to someone's IRL friends, family, or employer without their consent.

[SAFETY/SECURITY NOTES]
```
**Strongly consider enabling 2FA on your Discord account, if you haven't already.** Phishing attacks unfortunately do happen, and should you accidentally click on a malicious link, 2FA will save you and your account from compromise.

**Report any suspicious activity to @ModMail#5460.** This allows all of staff to assist you with your concern.

**We are not responsible for information shared in DMs.** There can be times when people DM you regarding information in stores, or regarding marketplace interactions or other content. Use your best judgement when clicking on links or negotiating deals. This does not mean that our rules about hate speech and kindness and threats do not apply in DMs - they most certainly do.
```ini
[OTHER NOTES]
```
**All buying and selling activity must be conducted through the Marketplace.** The marketplace is a feature designed to accommodate the community, but isn't the main feature of this server. It has its own set of additional rules, detailed in <#892606881581899826>. If you intend to buy or sell hardware here, you must read and accept them.

**Discord links are disabled.** This is mostly to prevent bot spam and other phishing attacks.
 
**Slowmode has been enabled on certain channels.** For example, our server has stock-alert channels intended specifically to notify people of stock at a particular store. As stated above, asking questions in stock-alerts channels is considered spam and will be removed.
