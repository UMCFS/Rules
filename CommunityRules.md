**You must read and agree to the rules to gain access to the server.**
**We follow ALL Discord Community Guidelines and abide by ALL clauses in Discord's Terms of Service. The staff team has FULL discretion regarding CG and ToS violations:**

   `Discord Community Guidelines:` https://discord.com/guidelines
   `Discord Terms of Service:` https://discord.com/terms

** Staff may moderate at their discretion.** While we've tried our best to write a comprehensive set of rules, nothing is perfect and not all situations may be considered. Any attempts to circumvent rules will not be tolerated, and staff has discretion to moderate anything beyond what's listed if we deem inappropriate.

[Rules]
```
1. **NO SCALPING OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXTREME MARKET DEMAND.** 
Scalping has many similar definitions, but we define scalping in two ways:
* Taking advantage of market shortages by selling items far above cost
* Deliberate purchasing of in-demand items with the express intent to resell for profit

**Users will be banned from here if found scalping anywhere.**  
The scope of this rule applies to all marketplaces, including ours here (which is governed by <#892606881581899826>), and applies all tech-related items. We do not care about resell of non-tech items like shoes and concert tickets, but we do reserve the right to exercise discretion as warranted, e.g. those who were caught scalping baby formula and toilet paper during the COVID-19 pandemic.

These behaviors are toxic, add no economic value, and cause frustration for users who want to buy hardware at a reasonable price. And while we vehemently discourage buying from scalpers, we don't intend to ban buyers who have purchased from scalpers, but we will ban if you resell a scalped item at a scalped price.

We generally define "cost" as what you paid for the item. A more thorough definition is detailed below:
> **Base Value** -
> __Purchased from an authorized retailer:__ the amount of money paid for your item on a receipt after any discounts, but before taxes and other costs.
> __Purchased from a private party or non-authorized retailer:__ the lowest value between these sources shall be used: the actual item sale price (before tax etc.), MSRP, or the current item pricing from an authorized retailer.
> 
> **(At) Cost** - Cost is the **Base Value**, plus applicable real, direct costs paid, such as tax, shipping charges, and the cost of a Micro Center transferrable warranty, if applicable.
> 
> **Full system build** - A functioning PC, minus peripherals and OS. A full build shall be assembled with a case, PSU, motherboard, CPU, RAM, disk, and modern GPU. **To qualify as a full system build, the PC must contain a discrete GPU currently being manufactured and sold** such as Nvidia RTX 5000/4000/3000 series, or AMD RX 7000/6000 series. This discourages those shucking GPUs out of pre-builts and reselling here.

```diff
-You may list or sell your item for no more than its Cost +$50 of profit, no matter the marketplace.
```
```diff
-If your build qualifies as a full build, you may list or sell it for no more than its cost +$200 of profit/build fees. Exception - legitmate business entities may continue pricing via your regular business channels as you wish, but any listings here must conform to the cost +$200 cap.
```
When listing or selling, reasonable shipping costs as well as PayPal G&S or similar transaction fees (not platform/listing fees, i.e. eBay) can be added to your cost, as these are commonly incurred when listing in our National marketplace or on Reddit HWS. Pirateship is a great resource for discounted shipping.

This profit can be used to recoup gas, fulfill a finders fee, cover your time and labor, etc., and must be included in your cost breakdown.

2. **Violating, or encouraging the violation of Micro Center policies is strictly prohibited.** This includes selling vouchers or line spots, or abusing Micro Center's return policies.

3. **Be kind and respectful.** No hate speech, no threats of violence, and no doxxing (the revealing of *private*, identifying information about someone in a public, online setting, including threats towards or revealing information to someone's IRL friends, family, or employer without their consent.) Also, this is an English-speaking Discord with English-speaking staff, so please stick to English.

4. **No political discussion.** Except in <#1092483332169793638> (18+ Adult Swim). If you're Active Member status ("Green" / Level 10), please see <#1092490901357600820> for more information on how to enroll in this channel.

5. **No spam or NSFW in non-age restricted channels.** Violations will result in warnings and/or mutes.

6. **Spreading false information __maliciously__ is prohibited.** We will not accept users trying to misguide others, including false reports about stock.

7. **Links with embedded referral codes, QR codes, or links to crowdfunding (GoFundMe, etc.) are not allowed.** This is mostly to prevent bot spam and other phishing attacks.

8. **Advertising other Discords, whether in the server or in DMs, without the permission of an admin is forbidden.** We censor Discord invites. Please DM <@575252669443211264> if you would like to request permission to share a particular server.

9. **Don't ask questions about stock in stock-alerts channels.** Messages in stock-alerts channels are intended to *provide* information about what's in stock at the store. Questions about stock can be directed to specific store-chat channels.

10. **Ban evasion is forbidden.** Creating a new account to get around a ban will result in your new account being banned, along with a report to Discord Trust and Safety, who will likely terminate all of your accounts permanently.

11. **Discussion of non-official retailers of keys and licensure for games, operating systems, etc. is forbidden.** Secondhand marketplaces such as G2A and Kinguin contain keys of unknown origin - this means your purchase may have been legal, but the origin of the purchase may not have been.

12. **We oppose the discussion of bots in the server.** This is case-by-case, but in many instances bots are used with the intention to purchase multiple and resell. This goes against the mission of the server, and in many cases the terms of service for respective companies.

[NOTES]
```
**Our moderation bots (Warship and Dyno) use DMs to let users know when they've committed infractions.** Blocking the bots or failure to enable DMs on this server may result in eventual warn, mute, kick, or ban without notification.

**Strongly consider enabling 2FA on your Discord account, if you haven't already.** Phishing attacks unfortunately do happen, and should you accidentally click on a malicious link, 2FA will save you and your account from compromise.

**Report any suspicious or concerning activity to <@575252669443211264>.** This allows all of staff to assist you with your concern.

**We are not responsible for information shared in DMs.** There can be times when people DM you regarding information in stores, or regarding marketplace interactions or other content. Use your best judgement when clicking on links or negotiating deals. This does not mean that our rules about hate speech and kindness and threats do not apply in DMs - they most certainly do.
